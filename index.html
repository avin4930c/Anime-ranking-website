                        <li>Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King.</li>
                        <li>However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.</li>
                        <li>This Anime is typical Shonen type. It has a standard protagonist like Naruto (and Luffy). He is simple minded, people look down on him and he is determined to change his life. He is on a journey to find strength and learn things that'll make him strong.</li>

It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary.</li>
                        <li>War is his home now. Though his father once told him, "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt," as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.</li>
                        <li>This anime is not for all the people but only for the selected ones. The character development is truly amazing and is an example to all the people watching it.</li>

                        <li>The JoJos tend to be charismatic outsiders, although they often gather teams around them as they set out on their quests. All of them also gain some form of supernatural powers, although the nature of those powers (as well as just how powerful they are) shifts dramatically when the series jumps from 1938 to 1988... but we'll get to that. There is a strong "good versus evil" aspect to the stories, although the morality can also be complex.</li>
                        <li>The JoJos are usually chaotic and sometimes even criminal, but the villains tend to be embodiments of pure evil, so it's never hard to figure out who to root for.</li>

                        <li>Enter Gintoki Sakata, an eccentric silver-haired man who always carries around a wooden sword and maintains his stature as a samurai despite the ban. As the founder of Yorozuya, a small business for odd jobs, Gintoki often embarks on endeavors to help other people—though usually in rather strange and unforeseen ways.</li>
                        <li>Gintama is a parody anime, it is completely different from the normal kind of anime. The characters are distinctive and each one of them has significance. I really enjoyed watching this anime and the the laugh at unexpected times. Only Men of culture can understand the jokes which are hidden.</li>

                        <li>One night, the Akagi Red Suns, an infamous team of street racers, visit the town of Akina to challenge the local mountain pass. Led by their two aces, Ryousuke and Keisuke Takahashi, the Red Suns plan to conquer every racing course in Kanto, establishing themselves as the fastest crew in the region. However, much to their disbelief, one of their aces is overtaken by an old Toyota AE86 during a drive back home from Akina.</li>
                        <li>I'm interested in cars and stuff, I can relate a lot of things with this and I have learnt a lot of things about cars from this anime. Even if you don't like cars or isn't much interested in cars, you'll eventually come to like them.</li>

                        <li>This anime is really special to me, It's not just the fights in this anime but the journey the MC goes through.

                        <li>This anime has all types of genres, it covers from standard viewpoint to the dark side of this world and it has made me laugh countless times and even gave me hard time recovering from tragic back stories. Hence it deserves to be my Most favourite Anime of All Time</li>
